# Dashboard
General use Dashboard build with HTML, JavaScript + Python and is run on a Raspberry PI.


# About the Project
## Purpose
This project was created to display multiple types useful information in a neat page that can be shown a a screen. 

First, I started off with a raspberry pi and was already doing numerous projects with it. 
I then found an old PC monitor that I was not using. (I later upgraded to a smaller TV and had to rescale some bits).

Personally, I wanted to see news/weather updates and the time/date on screen without constantly looking at a mobile phone for all the info. 
I set this info up and then started adding (and removing) additional tiles for some info that I wanted to see.
Some tiles that have been added include, 
* A surf report for beaches near my area
* Sports Results
* To Do List
* Updated Stock reading for companies I had an interest in

Altogether, I wanted a neat place for all the info to be displayed while also getting some experience with different API's and Technologies.
