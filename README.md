General use Dashboard build with HTML, JavaScript + Python and is run on a Raspberry Pi 3.


# About the Project
### Purpose
This project was created to display multiple categories of useful information in a neat page that can be shown a a screen. 

First, I started off with a Raspberry Pi and was already doing numerous projects with it. 
I then found an old PC monitor that I was not using. (I later upgraded to a smaller TV and had to rescale some bits).

Personally, I wanted to see news/weather updates and the time/date on screen without constantly looking at a mobile phone for all the info. 
I set this info up and then started adding (and removing) additional tiles for some info that I wanted to see.
Some tiles that have been added include, 
* A surf report for beaches near my area
* Sports Results
* To Do List
* Updated Stock reading for companies I had an interest in

Altogether, I wanted a neat place for all the info to be displayed while also getting some experience with different API's and Technologies.

# Setup

* Small TV / PC Monitor

## Install packages

* Raspbian (OS for Raspberry Pi)
 https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/
* Python (Framework)

# Technologies 
### Front End 
The base language used for design is HTML and CSS.
I used Bootstrap to organise the layout of the page and contents.
There is also some javascript and jQuery used for functionality on the front end.

### Back End
I have used python for the back end as it works well on Raspberry Pi.
I have used the flask library to run the website on.
